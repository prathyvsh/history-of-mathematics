** A Concise History of Mathematics
4 January 2021

A good review of mathematics starting from antiquity till the first half of 20th century. Particularly interesting is the periods between 17th-19th century which has been described in quite good detail given the limited number of pages devoted to each century. Author devotes a few chapters for mathematics from around the world (especially during the early phases), Europe and neigbhourhood regions are given central importance throughout the text.

** [[https://amzn.to/31O4yzi][Euclid’s Window]]
Leonard Mlodinow (2001)

A whirlwind tour of how reconfiguration of Eucild’s axioms lead to the birth of non-Euclidean geometries which figured a prominent role in the 20th and 21st century Physics and how it ended up influencing our understanding of the world. The details of the theoretical portions are presented for the lay person and hence only brief outlines are presented, but the historical trajectory being detailed is rather interesting to follow to understand how work in geometry influenced physical theories.

** The Study of the History of Mathematics ❤️
G. Sarton (1936)

It has the classic quote:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The ways of discovery must necessarily be very different from the shortest way, indirect and circuitous, with many windings and retreats. It is only at a later stage of knowledge, when a new domain has been sufficiently explored, that it becomes possible to reconstruct the whole theory on a logical basis, and to show how it might have been discovered by an omniscient being, that is, how it might have been discovered if there had been no real need of discovering it!
