* History of Mathematics

* Themes which influenced mathematics

- Hydrodynamics on function theory
- Kantianism and surveying on geometry
- Electromagnetism on differential equations
- Cartesianism on mechanics
- Scholasticism on calculus

* Prehistory
Some where in prehistory, counting began by mapping a set of things to objects. Counting with fingers enabled counting with a base that is with respect to an certain radix. Having 10 fingers means that you can now refer to 2 tens or 7 tens by abstracting out the base. This also forms a basis for arithmetic where you can say 14 is 10 + 4 or 114 is 100 * 1 + 10 * 1 + 1 * 4.

A Concise History of Mathematics by Dirk Struik says that calculi (pebbles/pointers) where first used and then came in a base with index that is fingers acting as a reference base.

Our body parts are in many ways the measure of things out there in the world.

Numbers were divided into Pentagonal, Square, Triangular, Friendly, Perfect, Prime, Composite, Odd, Even, Even times even, Odd times odd

The finding of irrational numbers was found not by extending the concept of numbers but by finding the synthesis is geometry.

* Three central problems in Greek Mathematics

Trisection of angle
Duplication of the Cube / Delian problem
Quadrature of the circle

None of these problems can be solved by the construction of a finite number of straight lines and circles except by approximation. These problems helped open up new fields of mathematics.

** A Concise History of Mathematics
4 January 2021

A good review of mathematics starting from antiquity till the first half of 20th century. Particularly interesting is the periods between 17th-19th century which has been described in quite good detail given the limited number of pages devoted to each century. Author devotes a few chapters for mathematics from around the world (especially during the early phases), Europe and neigbhourhood regions are given central importance throughout the text.

** [[https://amzn.to/31O4yzi][Euclid’s Window]]
Leonard Mlodinow (2001)

A whirlwind tour of how reconfiguration of Eucild’s axioms lead to the birth of non-Euclidean geometries which figured a prominent role in the 20th and 21st century Physics and how it ended up influencing our understanding of the world. The details of the theoretical portions are presented for the lay person and hence only brief outlines are presented, but the historical trajectory being detailed is rather interesting to follow to understand how work in geometry influenced physical theories.

** The Study of the History of Mathematics ❤️
G. Sarton (1936)

It has the classic quote:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The ways of discovery must necessarily be very different from the shortest way, indirect and circuitous, with many windings and retreats. It is only at a later stage of knowledge, when a new domain has been sufficiently explored, that it becomes possible to reconstruct the whole theory on a logical basis, and to show how it might have been discovered by an omniscient being, that is, how it might have been discovered if there had been no real need of discovering it!
