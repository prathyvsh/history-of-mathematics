* Notes on Intuitionism

I came across this idea as I was learning Lambda Calculus. I wanted to develop a deep understanding of this subject and this lead me to an investigation of the history of logic. As I kept pursuing this journey, I started coming across references to the works of Brouwer and Kant signaling that they were somehow influential in the birth of the idea of computability. This document is a result of my attempt to understand in some precision how their work is braided in the fabric of computation. I hope to share my findings here in a format accessible to a person curious about these ideas.
